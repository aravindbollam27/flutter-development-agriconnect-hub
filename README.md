### AgriConnect Hub

AgriConnect Hub is a multilingual, mobile-first digital ecosystem designed for farmers to overcome barriers such as market access, equipment affordability, language limitations, and lack of collaborative knowledge sharing.

The project was designed in Figma and implemented as a Flutter prototype, with future-ready architecture for backend and cloud deployment.

### Abstract

Agriculture remains the backbone of Indiaâ€™s economy but farmers still face challenges such as poor market access, high equipment costs, language barriers, and limited knowledge-sharing platforms.

AgriConnect Hub addresses these challenges with an all-in-one mobile app that combines:

Produce Marketplace

Equipment Rental Hub

Community Feed

Real-time Chat

Profile & Settings (My Listings, Notifications, Languages, Logout)

The system is simple, inclusive, and scalable, supporting six Indian languages for accessibility.


### Objectives

Design a user-friendly multilingual mobile app for farmers.

Integrate modules for marketplace, equipment hub, community feed, chat, and profile management.

Support English, Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, and Bangla.

Differentiate My Listings vs Othersâ€™ Listings for trust and personalization.

Provide real-time interactions and notifications.

Make the architecture future-ready for backend and cloud deployment.
